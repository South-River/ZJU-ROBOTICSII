# ZJU-ROBOTICSII

some code, just for simulation.

just star this repo if you like it or can help you.

## Path Planning

A*, i'm too lazy to code JPS again in python since A* can find correct path in 0.1~0.2s. if you want to get faster, maybe you can try to code a JPS/JPS+ in cpp.

## Trajectory Planning 

DWA, since we have to limit our speed in 0.2m/s, it seems to be a waste of time to adjust parameters for a long time...

TIPS: be sure that you had install GPU driver or maybe you can't get laser message. as a result, the car can't avoid obstacles.

## Odometry

ICP, maybe i will use kd-tree to get faster if i can finish my oslab and robotics vision.

## waiting for complete...
