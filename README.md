# ZJU-ROBOTICSII

some code, just for simulation

just star this repo if you like it or can help you

## Path Planning

A*, i'm too lazy to code JPS again in python since A* can find correct path in 0.1~0.2s. if you want to get faster, maybe you can try to code a JPS/JPS+ in cpp.

## Trajectory Planning 

DWA, since we have to limit our speed in 0.2m/s, it seems just a waste of time to adjust parameters for a long time...

## Odometry

ICP, maybe i will use kd-tree to get faster if i can finish my oslab and robotics vision

## waiting for complete...
